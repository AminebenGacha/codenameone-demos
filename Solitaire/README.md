# Solitaire Demo

This is a simple Solitaire Klondike app that was submitted to both Google and Apple and is available in both app stores as well as thru the web using the Codename One JavaScript port.

This isn't meant to be a great game or even a full demo of what Codename One can do, just a simple demo to get you started and show off the JavaScript port.

You can try it on devices or directly in the web browser here: https://www.codenameone.com/demos-Solitaire.html
