# Codename One Local Notifications Test

This is a sample app that uses local notifications in Codename One.

The app consists of a single form that allows you to enter some parameters to set up local notifications on the phone.   If you set up a repeating notification and then switch the app to the background (i.e. close the app or switch to another app), you should see the notification pop up if you are using iOS or Android.

Use the code in the LocalNotificationTest class as a sample of how to use local notifications.
